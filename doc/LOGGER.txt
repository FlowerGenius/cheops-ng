The logger is fairly straightforward.  Just include logger.h and then you
can start logging events with clog(LOG_x, ...)  Your choice for LOG_x is
one of:

	LOG_DEBUG:	Purely debugging information
	LOG_NOTICE:	Some event shouldn't happen, but it's not critical
	LOG_WARNING:	Something strange and important happened
	LOG_ERROR:	Something bad happened and program must terminate.

Just because you log something with LOG_ERROR, that does not make the
program terminate.
